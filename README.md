## "The Challenge" at Skicircus: Saalbach, Vorderglemm, Leogang, Fieberbrunn, Hinterglemm (Austria)
The Challenge at Skicircus Saalbach is an 65km long ski route at Saalbach, Austria (EU; no kangaroos). The [Saalbach website](https://www.saalbach.com/en/service/infrastructure/the-challenge-ski-your-limit_a_1721), [Home of LÃ¤ssig app](https://www.saalbach.com/en/live-info/mobile-app), [piste map](https://www.saalbach.com/en/winter/ski-resort/piste-map) and singnage on the mountains show the route of the Challenge, but a GPX track with the route is not avaliable.
After skiing the challenge myself, I exported my activity and converted it into a [GPX track for "The Challenge"](https://github.com/rzsykzmxpxzasqxtyxlveeanfu/geo/blob/main/The%20Challenge%20-%20Skicircus%20Saalbach%2C%20Vorderglemm%2C%20Leogang%2C%20Fieberbrunn%2C%20Hinterglemm.gpx). The file is compatible with various apps and wearables, allowing you to stay on course and finding the right lift.
